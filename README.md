# SalsHacks-Solution-2023
Hello this program is a prototype that was entered into a hackathon event.

The prompt was to develop a solution to engage student learning both in and out of the class room as test scores have taken a hit due to the pandemic.

The prototype is meant to simulate an app that uses AI to allow teachers to assign learning objectives to students and then students are able to choose the learning style that fits them (ie. visual, auditory, tactile) and an AI model would generate content that fits the needs of the students and the leaning objective at hand. 

In the prototype only one pathway is coded out for example purposes:

If you click admin then follow this pathway: Modern US History, Create New Assignment (fill out assignment as American Revolutionary War), Submit,Return to Home.

As a student follow this pathway: Modern US History, American Revolutionary War, Visual, (The I don't know learning style button is a link to a preexisting quiz and that is functional), and then the assignment and functional links to different visual resources related to the ARW should appear.

The CSS is not fully fleshed out due to time restrictions but in general that would be the basic layout for a web-based model of the app

Enjoy!
